# === Tiebreaking and deduplication configuration ===

tiebreaking_priority:
  - "z_flag_homogenized"          # Priority column 1: homogenized redshift quality flag (higher is better)
  - "instrument_type_homogenized" # Priority column 2: homogenized instrument type (e.g., s > g > p based on instrument_type_priority)

  # You may specify any column here as a tiebreaking criterion,
  # as long as:
  # - It exists in all catalogs being crossmatched.
  # - It is numeric (except for 'instrument_type_homogenized', which uses a string-to-priority mapping).
  # - Higher values are considered better; lower values are worse.
  # The columns will be evaluated in the order listed to resolve duplicates.

delta_z_threshold: 0.0005    # Maximum allowed redshift difference (|z1 - z2|) to resolve hard ties
                             # Applied only when initial tiebreaking via columns results in a tie (tie_result == 2)

crossmatch_radius_arcsec: 0.75  # Angular radius (in arcseconds) used to perform spatial crossmatching BETWEEN different catalogs
                               # This is NOT used for resolving internal duplicates (within the same catalog), 
                               # which are resolved only when RA and DEC are exactly equal (to 6 decimal places)

instrument_type_priority:
  s: 3     # Spectroscopic (most reliable type)
  g: 2     # Grism
  p: 1     # Photometric (least reliable)

# === Survey-specific translation rules for z_flag and type ===
# These are our internal definitions used to harmonize redshift quality and instrument types across surveys.
# The quality flag system is inspired by the VVDS survey but adapted to our needs:
#
# About the quality flag in our VVDS-inspired system:
# - 0: No redshift could be assigned
# - 1: Confidence < 70% (tentative redshift)
# - 2: 70% < Confidence < 90%
# - 3: 90% < Confidence < 99%
# - 4: Confidence > 99%
# - 6: Object identified as non-extragalactic (e.g., stars)

# Each block corresponds to a survey name and includes:
# - z_flag_translation: how to map original quality flags or based on conditions into a standardized quality scale (0-6)
# - instrument_type_translation: how to map original types into a standard label (s, g, p)
# You can mix value-based mappings and conditional rules (using Python expressions)
