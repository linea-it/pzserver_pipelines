# pzserver_pipelines

Repository to host the PZ Server's pipelines: 

### Combine Spec-z Catalogs
> Combine multiple spectroscopic redshift catalogs into a single sample with homogenized data formats and a unique system of quality flags translated from the survey's original files.  

### Training Set Maker 
> Create customized training and validation/test sets using a compilation of spectroscopic redshifts and LSST photometric data.


Software developed and delivered as part of the in-kind contribution program BRA-LIN, from LIneA to the Rubin Observatory's LSST. An overview of this and other contributions is available [here](https://linea-it.github.io/pz-lsst-inkind-doc/).
