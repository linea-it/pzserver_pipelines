# WARNING!

For these configuration files to work without requiring changes, the file to be used must be moved to the pipeline's root directory (```combine_redshift_dedup/```).

If you don't move them, you'll need to change the paths in the catalogs and flags_translation.yaml in those configuration yaml files.
